    "description": "Big data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is to be able to exploit as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible and as fast as possible. The big challenge is \"how to turn data into useful knowledge\". This is far from a simple task and a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can \"scale up\" and \"scale out\". Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its potential, i.e., to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores. Scale out refers to the ability to use more than 1 machines (typically 100s or 1000s) effectively. This is a research oriented class. Every week we will read two modern research papers; one from the scale up area and one from the scale out area. We will use examples from several areas, including relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (i.e., for social networks), key value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems as well as mobile computing. Each student will work on a semester long data systems research project (in groups of 2-4 students) which can be in any of the above areas and will be based on an open research problem.",

    "description": "The Internet operates in layers, and so does much of the technology that hooks up to it: PCs, mobile phones, tablets. Nearly two decades ago those platforms were conceptually simple: a \"generative\" base offered by one manufacturer, on which any third party could build. (Think: Windows and the programs that run on it.) Some efforts by platform makers to tip the scales in their favor in the layer above resulted in extended controversy and regulatory efforts, such as over Windows coming bundled with Internet Explorer. Today platforms are just as vital but far more complex. We have hybrids like the iOS and Android operating systems or the Facebook and Twitter platforms, where the platform makers offer their systems as services rather than products, influencing and sometimes outright limiting connection between users and independent developers for those platforms. How should we think about these new platforms? What counts as a \"level playing field,\" and what responsibility, if any, is there for public authorities to enforce it? What lessons, if any, do the prior tangles offer for today?",

Further advancements in networking are expected to similarly transform the technological landscape over the next decade through the emergence of the Internet of Things and gigabit wireless networks. In order to play a role in this era of new network-powered advancements, students must have a thorough understanding of emerging networking topics. Rather than teaching the basic networking protocols, which have become very mature and can be treated as a black box, in CS 143, we will teach the new issues and topics of interest which will power important emerging applications. This focus on upcoming applications is the motivation for CS 143 this semester. The class will be organized into the following nine modules: Basic Networking Concepts: Protocol Layering; Internet of Things: All-service Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE); Data Center Networking: Software Defined Networking; Web-scale Networking: Distributed Cloud Computing and Virtual Machine Migration; Content Networks: Video Streaming; Network Security: Defense Against Protocol Exploitation; Wireless Networking: Wireless Mesh, Geographic Routing; Machine Learning Assisted Networking: End-to-end Application Adaptive Protocols; Cyber-physical Networks: Vehicular Networking.
